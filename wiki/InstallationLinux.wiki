#summary Describes how to install 7thSense under Linux

= Ubuntu =

  * Extract "seventhsense-`*`.zip" (where "`*`" is the current build no.) to your hard disc, if you're not sure where to put it extract the files to _/home/*yourName*/Documents/7thSense_. You may do so by double clicking the zip-file.
  * Move to the folder you just extracted the files to, right click seventhsense.jar and choose *"Properties"*.
  * Open the *"Permissions"* tab and check *"Execute"*.
  * Open the *"Open with"* tab and choose *"OpenJDK Java 6 Runtime"*. If there is no such entry you need to install Java first - see the appropriate entry in this wiki.
Now you can run the program by double clicking *"seventhsense.jar"*.

If there are issues with sound playback you need to install libopenal. See step 1 and 2 at *Other Linux*.
